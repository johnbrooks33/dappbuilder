## Problem

You created a smart contract...now what?

**There is no easy way to share a smart contract interface!**

The goal of this project is to make it easier to interact with smart contracts. OneClickDapp instantly builds you a dApp with a simple URL to bookmark or share with a friend. Anyone with the dApp URL can interact with _your shiny new smart contract_, and access all functions at the correct address/network. Don't write a single line of front-end code. Forget about verifying your contract on Etherscan or MEW. Your dApp is just one click away!

## Planned

- Ganache forking to emulate any mainnet dApp
- IPFS for saving dApps
- Custom ENS domains e.g., "myDapp.oneclickdapp.ETH"
- Full decentralization for permanence and security
- "Copy the code" button to build your own React app
- Display Events and Transactions using Dapparatus

1.  Run `npm install` in both root directory, and in `/client`
2.  Create `config.js` in `./db/` and enter your mongoDB URL
    > process.env.MONGODB_URI = "mongodb://..."
3.  cd to root directory and run `npm start`
